###### How does something becomes a resource?
</div>
<div class="box-content" markdown="1">things become resources only when they have a value. 

“Its use or utility gives
it a value. All resources have some value.”
</div>
</div>

Value means worth. Some resources have economic
value, some do not.

For example, metals may have an
economic value, a beautiful landscape may not. But both
are important and satisfy human needs.

Some resources can become economically valuable
with time.

Time and technology are two important factors that
can change substances into resources
